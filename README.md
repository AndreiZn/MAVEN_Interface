# MAVEN_Interface
Visualization tool for MAVEN data

The idea is to create a program that will visualize data from any Source (now it's the MAVEN files). Matlab scripts are collected in
the Scripts folder. They get Source, axis to be built in and specific arguments. Specific arguments should be described by script coders 
should be placed in the Arguments folder with a name ScriptName_Args.m.
